Assignment Requirements

Create a new Java Project in your Eclipse workspace named as before, smith7 or jones7 for example.
Create a package with the very same name as your project name.
In this one package, write one Java program for each exercise as required below.
Adhere to naming conventions for variables and classes as in section 2.8.
Choose descriptive variable names and identifiers in all programs.
Start each program with your name and SPC ID# in a comment.
Add a few more comments in each program to explain what your code is doing.
When all programs are done, locate your project folder in your workspace.
Right-click on the project folder folder (don't open it!) and select "Send to" --> "Compressed (zipped) folder". This will make a zip with the same name as your project.
Take screenshots of your running project (the Java code) and the project output and put them in a separate folder. Name it "screenshots" + module #+ your last name. The screenshots can be jep or png files. Zip up the folder.
Upload the zipped folders to this drop box.
Type your collaboration statement (Have you worked with others or used other resources on this assignments?) into the message area of the drop box.
Submit your assignment.
Exercise 1
Create a Java program with a method that searches an integer array for a specified integer value (see help with starting the method header below). If the array contains the specified integer, the method should return its index in the array. If not, the method should throw an Exception stating "Element not found in array" and end gracefully. Test the method in main with an array that you make and with user input for the "needle".

public static int returnIndex(int[ ] haystack, int needle) {

Exercise 2
Write a program that generates 10 random doubles, all between 1 and 11, and writes them to a text file, one number per line. Then write another program that reads the text file and displays all the doubles and their sum accurate to two decimal places.
